# Internship-task-9--SQL-Data-Modeling-Build-a-Star-Schema

## Project Overview
This project focuses on designing and implementing a **Star Schema data model** using the **Global Superstore dataset**.  
The objective is to transform a transactional retail dataset into a **data warehouse–ready schema** optimized for analytical queries and BI reporting.

## Dataset
**Global Superstore – Retail Sales Dataset**

The dataset contains  order-level data including:
- Customer information
- Product details
- Order dates
- Geographic regions
- Sales, profit, quantity, and discounts

## Tasks Performed
- Identified fact and dimension tables
- Designed star schema with primary and foreign keys
- Created dimension and fact tables using SQL
- Loaded distinct dimension values from raw data
- Inserted transactional data into fact table
- Created indexes for query optimization
- Ran analytical queries using star schema joins
- Validated record counts and foreign key mappings
- Exported analytical results and schema diagram

##  Tools & Technologies
- **Database:** PostgreSQL / MySQL
- **Dataset:** Global Superstore
- **Diagram Tool:** dbdiagram.io / draw.io
- **Query Language:** SQL

##  Learning Outcome
- Understanding of fact and dimension modeling
- Hands-on experience with star schema design
- Ability to support BI dashboards and analytics
- Industry-standard data warehouse modeling skills
